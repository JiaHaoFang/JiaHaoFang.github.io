<li>
<p>If we believe death is the end, how could death be bad for me?</p>
<p>I don’t exist, it can’t be bad for me</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Death is bad for the survivors</p>
<p>It means losing friends or family for the survivors</p>
<p>—— Learning of a friend’s death is more terrifying than being separated from a friend</p>
<p>—— It can’t be at the core in terms of what’s bad about death.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The central badness of death</p>
<p>How could it be true that death is bad for the person that dies?</p>
<p>—— We’ve got to focus on my being dead rather than being afraid of dead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physicalists: Once I die, I cease to exist. I don’t exist.</p>
<p>How can nonexistence be bad for me?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>distinction between two different way  in which something can be bad for me.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In an absolute, robust intrinsic sense (Pain)</p>
<p>Something we want to avoid for its own sake.</p>
<p>—— They are bad by virtue of their very nature.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>comparatively sense</code></p>
<p>While you’re doing this, you are not getting something better.</p>
<p>Something can be bad comparatively, something can be bad because of what you are not getting while you get this bad thing.</p>
<p>—— They are by virtue of “The opportunity costs”.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The deprivation account of the evil or badness of death</p>
<p>dead is bad because of the lack of the good things in life (in second sense)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OBJECTION</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Timing of the badness of death</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If anything is true, any fact has to have a time when it’s true</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If dead is bad for me, it’s a fact, when is that fact true?</p>
<p>Death can’t be bad for me now, because I’m alive. Death can’t be bad for me when I’m dead, because I’m no more.</p>
<p>—— My death is bad for me during the time I’m dead. Because during that time I’m deprived of the good things in life.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Argument</p>
<ol>
<li>something can be bad for you only if you exist. - <code>Existence requirement</code></li>
<li>when you’re dead you don’t exist - Truth</li>
<li>CONCLUSION: Death can’t be bad for you</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Argument of existence requirement</p>
<p>Nonexistence guarantee that you’re deprived of something</p>
<p>—— death is bad by rejecting the existence requirement</p>
<p>—— for the potential never-to-be-born people, a lot of people, that it’s a tragedy that they never get born, it’s a moral tragedy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two version of Existence requirement</p>
<ol>
<li>Modest version: something can be bad for you only if you exist at <u>some</u> time or the other - Accepted</li>
<li>Bolder version:  something can be bad for you  only if you exist at the <u>same</u> time as that thing</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Modest Existence requirement maybe the best possible view.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nonexistence before we born and after we die —— Lucretius’ puzzle</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Common response</p>
<p>The period after my death, I am no longer alive, I have <u>lost</u> my life</p>
<p>In contrast, the period before my birth, although I’m not alive, I have not lost my life, I’ve never yet been alive. —— You cannot lost something you’ve never yet had.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Schmoss (尚无)</p>
<p>The period before my birth, there’s no loss of life, but there’s a schmoss of life.</p>
<p>—— What is it about the fact that we don’t have something that we used to, that makes it worse than that no having something that we’re going to?</p>
<p>—— Why do we care more about not having what once upon a time we <u>did</u>, than we care about not having what once upon a time we <u>will</u>?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arguments</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nagel’s answer</p>
<p>The date of my death is a <u>contingent</u> fact about me, but the date of my birth is not a contingent fact about me.</p>
<p>The date of my birth mean the time at which I come in to existence.</p>
<p>That’s an <u>essential</u> moment in my life story.</p>
<p>—— fertility clinic, not to be an adequate answer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fred Feldman’s answer</p>
<p>When we imagine being born earlier, we don’t imagine a longer life, we imagine <u>shift my life forward</u>.</p>
<p>—— If I can born earlier, I can have a longer life for now</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Derek Parfit ’s answer</p>
<p>Why loss is worse than schmoss? Because we have of caring about the future in a way that we don’t care about the past. It’s a very deep fact about <u>human caring</u>.</p>
<p>e.g.: We do want the pain to be in the past. We don’t want the pain in the future.</p>

<h3 id="immortality"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#immortality"></a> Immortality</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Question One</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does consistency, does logic, require somebody who accepts the deprivation account believe immortality is a good thing? —— No</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strictly speaking, what the deprivation account says is, death is bad insofar as you’re deprived of the good things.</p>
<p>Dead is bad, when it’s bad, by virtue of the fact that it deprives you of the good things in life.</p>
<ul>
<li>We’re not committed to the claim that death is always bad. We have to look and see, what would life actually hold out for us.</li>
<li>Things that are good for you in limited quantities can become bad for you if you get more and more of them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Question Two</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even if logic doesn’t require that, is it true that immortality is a good thing?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What should we think about the prospect of living forever?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Older, weaker, discomfort.</p>
<p>Death is blessing, because it puts an end to the pain and suffering and misery that afflict us in our old age.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Science fiction. Health and anything you want. Is it could be a good thing?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What kind of life can you imagine such that having that life forever would be good?</p>
<p>—— No kind of life would be one that would be desirable and attractive forever. Every life would be eventually become tedious and worse.</p>
<p>—— The fact of out mortality is good rather than bad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To say that immortality is bad is not to say it’s a good thing that we die when we do. It could be bad that it comes too soon for all of us</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Imagine a pleasure-making machine</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>What is it about the facts about life and death that seem to make it misguided to think we should just put them aside and pay no attention to them?</p>
<p>Presumably because we’re led to the thought that nature of death should have an impact on how we live. The appropriate way to live gets shaped at least in past by the fact that we’re going to die. It seems as though there’d be something irrational and inappropriate about simply disregarding those facts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two way in which facts could influence our behavior</p>
<ol>
<li>It could be that certain facts would <u>cause</u> you to behavior differently without actually giving you any reason to behave differently.</li>
<li>The facts change your behavior by giving you a reason to behave differently. The facts would give you some good <u>reason</u> to change.</li>
</ol>
<p>The mere fact that they would change your behavior doesn’t yet tell you they’re reason-generating facts.</p>
<p>If they’re mere causes and not reasons, then maybe it’s perfectly okay to disregard them.</p>
<p>But what if someone said that we should always be thinking about the facts about death?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are times and places for thinking about the fact of death.</p>
<p>What is the appropriate response to to the facts about life and death?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="response-to-death"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#response-to-death"></a> Response to death</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is fear of death a rationally <code>appropriate</code> response?</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the <u>appropriateness conditions</u> for fear?
<ol>
<li>To be afraid of something it’s got to be bad.</li>
<li>There’s got to be non-negligible change of the bad state of affairs happening.</li>
<li>We need to have a certain amount of uncertainty in order to have fear be appropriate.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>it doesn’t make fear appropriate if it’s obsessive fear, horrendous fear, tremendous fear.
<ul>
<li>Maybe some mild concern is all that’s appropriate if the chance are small.</li>
<li>The amount of fear needs to be proportioned to the size of the bad.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are we supposedly being afraid of when we are afraid of that? Perhaps two or three things need to be distinguished.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Process of dying</p>
<p>Some people find that the actual process at the end of their life is a painful and unpleasant one.</p>
<p>The probability of death is low</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being dead</p>
<p>They are afraid of death itself, afraid of being dead.</p>
<p>Is being dead intrinsically a bad thing? Being dead per se is not the sort of thing it makes sense to be afraid of, once you’ve concluded that death is the end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unpredictability of death</p>
<p>We are afraid of when we are going to die.</p>
<p>It’s the unpredictability that leaves you in a position of not knowing whether death will come soon.or death will come late.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>How much fear is appropriate?</p>
<p>How great is the change that you’ll die too soon? Your fear needs to be proportioned to the likelihood.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most part fear of death does not make sense</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What about some of other possible emotions? What negative emotion does it make sense to feel about death itself, the fact that you’re going to die?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since we’ve argued that immortality would be bad, the fact that you will die is not actually bad. Because it saves you from the unpleasant aspect of the eternal, dreary, dreadful immortal existence. But we still said most of us die too soon.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Anger</p>
<p>Anger itself has appropriateness conditions.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It got to be directed at a person, an agent. It got to be directed at some thing that had some choice over what was doing to you.</p>
<p>You get angry to some thing because you personified it. It doesn’t make sense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anger makes sense only when the agent has wronged you, has treated you in a way that it was morally inappropriate for them to treat you.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Does it make sense then to be angry at the fact we are going to die?</p>
<ul>
<li>Who or what is it that you think is the cause of your morality?
<ul>
<li>God has condemned us to death.</li>
<li>Universe theory</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn’t make sense either.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sorrow</p>
<p>The world is a wonderful place. It would be better to have more of it. I’m sad that I don’t get more.</p>
<p>Although it’s pity I don’t get more, I’m extremely lucky to have gotten as much as I get.</p>
</li>

<p>The right emotional response isn’t fear, anger, it’s <code>gratitude</code> that we’re able to be alive at all.</p>

<h3 id="how-should-we-live"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#how-should-we-live"></a> How should we live</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>How should we live in light of the fact we’re going to die?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>That fact that we’re mortal requires us to fact the fact that intuitively we can blow it.</p>
<p>But it can’t be mortality, per se, that has this implication.</p>
<p>Even if we live forever, we can still do it wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two kinds of care that we have to take (we have a limited amount of time to do it over.)</p>
<ul>
<li>We have to be careful in our aims</li>
<li>We have to be careful in out execution of our aims.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s the fact that we have a relatively short span of life relative to how much there is worth aiming for, and how complicated and difficult it can be to get those things and get them right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What death forces us to do is be more <code>careful</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What kinds of contents should we try to fill our lives with?</p>
<p>We haven’t got much time. Pack as much as you can into life. There two basic strategies about put that idea into practice.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You should settle for the kinds of goals that you’re virtually guaranteed that you’ll accomplish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some of more valuable things in life are things that don’t come to ready don’t come with guarantees of achieving them. These things are the most valuable things in our life.</p>
<p>The life aiming for greater accomplishments, is also a life with a greater chance of failure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mixture above two. So, what is the right mixture?</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Life quality can trump quantity</p>
<p>Is quality only important insofar as it get folded into producing greater quantity? Or does quality matter in its own right as something that’s worth going for, even when it means a smaller quantity?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maybe a kind of immortality is worth going after</p>
<p>Previously we’ve argued that genuine immortality unending life, would not be a good thing. But many of us aspire to this kind of <code>semi-immortality</code>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You take comfort in the thought that literally there are a parts of you will continue.</p>
<p>This strikes me as a kind of desperate striving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your accomplishments will continue to last after you.</p>
<p>There are something worth doing about producing something that continues for a while. Even if my life here on earth is s short one, if something that I’ve accomplished continues, my life is the better for it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Common underlying belief:</p>
<p>The way to deal with the fact that we live and then we’re dead is to try to make the life that you’ve got as good as possible as valuable as possible to pack as much into it as you can.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Different approach</p>
<p>It’s only horrible insofar as you think of life as something that it’s bad to lose. Buddhism.</p>

<h2 id="suicide"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#suicide"></a> Suicide</h2>
<h3 id="question-of-rationality"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#question-of-rationality"></a> Question of rationality</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Could it ever be true that you’d be better off dead?</p>
<p>If the existence they got is worse than not existing at all?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Two-state Requirement</code> 双态要求</p>
<p>I kill myself, I don’t exist. There is no second state to compare. It’s got a logical mistake built right into it.</p>
<p>You can’t even say you are better off staying alive. This is very hard to believe.</p>
<p>Example like ‘Thank you for saving my life’ shows that two-state requirement isn’t a genuine requirement on the sort of evaluations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether or not there could be such lives depends on your view about what’s the correct account of well-being.</p>
<p>There are philosophical differences of opinion with regard to whether or not a life could be so bad that it would be better for it to come to an end.</p>
<p>According to the <u>theory of the good</u>, do all objective goods outweigh the bad? If the bad outweigh the good your life is not worth living.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Namely, is life itself worth having? — valuable container theory</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Suicide can never be rational because it’s never true that you’re better off dead. — Fantastic valuable container theory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Life has some finite intrinsic value, and in principle, even that could be outweigh if the contents get bad enough — Modest valuable container theory</p>
<p>It vary from person to person.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>When would suicide make scene?</p>
<p>It’s straight forward to say if your life is going to <u>become worse than nothing</u> and you <u>have complete control over when you kill yourself</u>, the precise moment at which suicide would become rational would be exactly that moment at which your life became not worth having.</p>
<p>If only the person could recognize the facts and <code>know for certainty</code> that’s what their line was going to look like, suicide would at certain points be rational.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>BUT</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Could it be rational for you to judge that your situation is one in which the line’s going to go below long enough so that on balance you’d be better off dead?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assume for the moment that you can think clearly about your situation.</p>
<p>If you kill yourself, you’ve thrown any chance of recovery. — It doesn’t make sceneView above must be mistaken. In deciding whether to kill yourself what you doing is playing the odds, you’re gambling. But gambling is something we do all the time and indeed, there is no getting away from the fact.</p>
<p>It’s just one of the facts of life about how we have to decide. We have to make your decisions under uncertainty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What about this point about thinking clearly?</p>
<p>Anybody for whom it would be true would be have to be so emotionally distressed that they’re not able to think clearly, so they can’t have a judgment that’s trustworthy, so you should not trust it, so suicide could never turn out to be a rational opinion after all.</p>
<p>Can’t there be cases where despite the fact that your thinking is clouded, it still reasonable to trust the decisions that you make within your clouded thinking?</p>
<p>It can’t be a good argument. — Surgery case</p>
<p>What does seem right is precisely because you’re working and deciding under the cloud of emotional stress and pain, that you should tink twice and third time, you should not make this decision in haste.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Conclude</p>
<ul>
<li>As long as we’re focused on the question of the rationality of suicide, ethics aside, the rationality of suicide under certain circumstances, suicide could be rationally justified.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="question-of-morality"><a class="markdownIt-Anchor" href="#question-of-morality"></a> Question of morality</h3>
<ul>
<li>Some quick and dirty arguments
<ol>
<li>
<p>Suicide is illegitimate because it’s thwarting God’s will.</p>
<p>In this view, saving somebody is also thwarting God’s will? The God’s will argument cuts both ways which is to say it doesn’t give us any guidance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We’ve been given life and life pretty amazing so we have an obligation, a debt of gratitude to keep the gift.</p>
<p>Pay attention to what exactly obligation of gratitude require us to do. In particular, it’s important to bear in mind that you owe the person who gives you a gift something only when what he’s giving you is a gift.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What is it that makes an action morally acceptable or morally forbidden?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The <code>consequences</code> of your action matter.（结果原则）</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It affects themselves, family and loved ones</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Utilitarianism（功利主义）</p>
<p>Consequences matter and  they are all that matters.</p>
<p>It‘s the moral doctrine that says right and wrong is a matter of producing as much happiness for everybody as possible.</p>
<p>It would be a moderate conclusion, in certain circumstances suicide will be morally justified.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>the branch of moral theory as <code>deontology</code> （义务论）</p>
<p>The factor of not just what was the upshot of your action , but how you produced that upshot. Not just what the results were, but what was your means of getting those result.</p>
<p>And more particularly still, did you have to <code>harm</code> anybody to produce the results?（禁止伤害原则）</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If we accept deontology</p>
<p>Suicide is immoral because I kill myself, an innocent person. Killing an innocent person is morally wrong.</p>
<p>The right to life outweighs the appeal to consequences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Response</p>
<p>Morality is only about how I treat others. It’s not about how I treat myself.</p>
<p>The right to life only cover how I treat others. It doesn’t have any implications for how I treat myself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It seems to me more plausible to say morality includes not only governing how I treat others but also how I treat myself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a deontological prohibition against harming innocent people but what it’s really a prohibition against, is leaving them worse off <u>overall</u>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’ve obviously got my own agreement when I suicide. I have my own <code>consent</code> to what I’m doing.（同意原则）</p>
<p>We should have some relevant conditions to put into a proper version of the consent principle.</p>
<p>Suppose we’ve got some kind of modified consent principle, what should we say about suicide then?</p>
<p>Where somebody rationally assesses their situation, see that they’re better off dead, think the case through, doesn’t rush into it, make an informed and voluntary decision with good reason behind it in a situation like that it seems to me  the consent principle might well come into play.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>So suicide will again be acceptable in some cases, though not in all.</li>
